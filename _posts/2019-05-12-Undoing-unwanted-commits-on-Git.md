I’m sure that once in a while, it just happens that you made a mistake. That’s ok. It happens.

But what if you commit the mistake. Several times. A headache for sure and so many other horrible things as well.

For those cases, I really recommend giving a read to [On undoing, fixing, or removing commits in git](http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitFixUm/). A document made by Seth Robertson.

It contains lot of resources for very incredible situations. I read it some times and it helps me out many others.
